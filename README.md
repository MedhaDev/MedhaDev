👋 Hi, I’m Medha Devalraj.

🎓 I'm a graduate student at Penn State, majoring in Information Systems. I'm also working as a Research Specialist & Data Analyst at ISRA, Penn State Harrisburg.

🌱 Recently, I’ve been focused on advanced SQL development - including stored procedures, window functions, and performance optimization. I’ve also been sharpening my Power BI skills with advanced data modeling, DAX, and scalable dashboard design. These efforts are all part of building a strong portfolio and technical foundation as I work toward landing a full-time data analyst role.

💞️ I enjoy connecting with professionals in tech & Research community to learn more about their job role, work life, and all the other fun stuff that comes with it! Outside of work, I love exploring different cuisines, cooking new dishes, and watching great films(occasionally some mainstream or brainrot ones as well).

📫 How to reach me: [Message me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/medhasharma-dev) or email me at [medhasharma.dev@gmail.com](mailto:medhasharma.dev@gmail.com)

📂 I’m currently building my data analytics portfolio — stay tuned for new projects soon!
